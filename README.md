# RateMyDog

An app that lets you rate dogs with images from the [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/)! It is written in TypeScript with Angular.

I was able to complete goals 1-6 fully, this app:
- Gets a dog
- Lets you rate the dog
- Loads a new dog to rate
- Lets you look at all the dogs you've rated
- Sorts the dogs by highest rated (or lowest)
- You can select dogs by breed to rate

## Running the development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
